Nakagami Distribution
Any signal undergoing multi-path propagation or changing direction at multiple instances during its whole journey can be genarally treated as random walks. The simple examples are ultrasound signal, communication wireless signals , light wave etc. This is more often seen in the backscattered signal. Backscattering is the reflection of a wave (such as a radio wave, light wave, or acoustic wave) off a surface or interface, in the direction opposite to the direction of the incoming wave.

The envelope of received ultrasonic echo is R which follows following ditributions:
Rayleigh Distribution : X , Y are Gaussian distributed. μ = 0, var = equal.
Pre-Rayleigh Distribution : X, Y are not Gaussian distributed. var = high.
Post-Rayleigh / Rician Distribution : X , Y are Gaussian distributed. μ = unequal, var = equal.

To evaluate the characteristics of envelope R with this distributions is complex in terms of computations as well as time consuming. Therefore shankar consolidated this distributions and provided a model Nakagami distribution.
